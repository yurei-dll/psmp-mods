# PSMP-MODS
The main purpose of this repo is to serve a mod list + installer for a private server. If you're here for that, just download `mod_installer.cmd` and run it. It will refer back to `list.txt` and download everything to the `.minecraft/mods` folder.

As for everything else, I figured theres no harm in including it. Use `listGen.js` to gather direct download links and put them in the txt file.
